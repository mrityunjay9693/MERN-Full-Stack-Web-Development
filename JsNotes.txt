Javascript:->Javascript is the language for the web. It is the mosty popular leightweight, interpreted compiled
             programming languagewhich is used for both client-side as well as  server-side development. JavaScript
             is also known as scripting languiage for web pages.

console.log():->It is a method which outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string or
                it may be any one or more javascript objects.

script tag:->script tag is used to link your javascript with the html.
             script tag is not the part body in the html page.

                        ***** Fundamentals of JavaScript *****

Variables : In JavaScript, variable is a name given to a memory location which is used to store any 
            type of data in it. It is an entity which is used to store information or data is called variables.
            Varibales used to stores values that means it is an conatiner for storing values/information/data.
            If required, values or data in a varibale can be changed/updated anytime later in the program. Variables 
            is a symbolic name or reference for a data/values.
            There are three types to declare an entity as varibales which are mentioned 
            aas follows :-
            a)var
            b)let and,
            c)const.

Rules while declaring a variable in javascript : 
            
            Rule 1 :- 



Notes: There is no type specification in javascript. That means we don't need to mentioned or tell
       about the data type of varibales i.e., of what kind of values will be inside in varibales. 
       Hemce, javascript is an dynamically typed or dynamic in nature programming language.
    
a)var : 'var' statement declares function-scoped or globally-scoped variables optionally initializing each to a value
        var is a keyword in javascript which is used to declare an entity as varibale which is always be initialized 
        with an undefined value. This means that let suppose 'a' is a varibale which is declared by var as var a;, 
        then value which will be stored in 'a' will be undefined.

        Ex : var a;
             console.log(value in a is +a);
             // output : value in a is undefined. 
      ->The value in the variable 'a' declared with var keyword will be undefined unless we give it some values. As 
        soon as a value is given to varibale 'a', the value is updated from 'undefined' to 'value given in a'.
        Hence JavaScript is a single-threaded or synchronou programming language.

        Ex : var a = 33;
            14 console.log(value in a is +a);
             // output : value in a is 33. 

Notes:- JavaScript is a synchronous in behaviour programming language.
        A javascript program is interpreted line by line.

Notes:- JavaScript is dynamically-typed programming language because while declaring a varibale, we are not 
        specifying its data type. 

Limitations/issues using 'var' :
        
        a)Redeclarations: First limitations/issues comes to var is its behaviour of 'redeclarations'. Once a 
                          variable 'b'is declared using var, programer can again declare another varibale by 
                          same name 'b' and this will create a confusions for others and a lots of bugs will 
                          be created. 
                          Ex: var a = 1;
                              var a = 5;
                              console.log(a);
                              //Output: 5
                          In this example   have declare varibale 'a' twice with same name in the same
                          scope without any error. The second declaration will assigns a new value i.e., 5 to 
                          the existing variable which will lead to an unexpected behaviour, especially in larger 
                          codebase and result to number of unwanted bugs to programer.

Notes: To address the issue of redeclarations and improve code quality and maintainability, modern JavaScript 
       introduced let and const. Using let and const for variable declarations enforces block scoping and prevents 
       redeclarations within the same scope

Notes: 'var' keyword is not used anymore in industries and it is one of the important attraction of interview purpose.

                                            Data Types                                                           
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Types: In programming language, data type is an attribute which is associated with a 
            peice of data that tells the computer system about the quality of data it will
            havewith different sizes. 
            In JavaScript, data types represents the kind of value that can be stored and manipulated
            in a program.
            JavaScript has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into two main groups:
             1)Primitive data types.
             2)Non-primitive data types or reference data types.
1)Primitive data types: following are five types of primitive data types available in javascript as follow:  
                        a)Number:
                             Ex:var Sno = 2.1;
                                var tno = 201.1234
                                console.log('a)Numbers data types: ') 
                                console.log(fno +' is integer');
                                console.log(Sno +' is float')
                                console.log(tno +' is in double\n'); 

                        b)String:
                             Ex:console.log("b)String Data Type: ")
                                var s1 = 't';
                                var s2 = 'tilde';
                                console.log("'"+s2+"'" +" is a string.");
                                console.log("'"+s1+"'"+' is also a string\n');
                        c)Boolean:
                             Ex:var t = true;
                                var f = false;
                                console.log("c)Boolean Data Types: ");
                                console.log('t: '+t, ' f: '+f+'\n');

                        d)Undefined:
                             Ex:var u;
                                var u1 = undefined;
                                console.log('d)Undefined Data Types: ');
                                console.log('u: '+u)
                                console.log('u1: '+u1+'\n');
                        e)Null:
                             Ex:var n = null;
                                console.log('e)Null Data Types: ');
                                console.log('n: '+n);
