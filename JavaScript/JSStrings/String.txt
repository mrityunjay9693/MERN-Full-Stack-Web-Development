String : String in JavaScript is defined as the sequence of characters.
         String in JavaScript is written either in single quotation or double quotation.
         There is also anothe way to write string within it which is known as backtick characters, will discuss 
         later.
         
         Syntax : let variableName = "Given string by users";

         Example : let stateName = "Bihar";
                   let cityName = 'Muzaffarpur';
                   console.log(stateName); //Bihar
                   console.log(cityName);  //Muzaffarpur

length : length is a property of string in JavaScript is used to find length of the given string i.e.,
         total number of character inside a string.

         Syntax : string_variable.length; or "given string".length

         let str = "tildetech";
         let lengthOfString = str.length;
         console.log("Total length of " + str + " is");
         console.log(lengthOfString); //9

         let stateName = "Bihar";
         console.log(stateName.length); //5

         let len = "Muzaffarpur".length;
         console.log(len); //11

         console.log("India".length); //5

JavaScript Methods/Functions : JavaScript provides a variety of built-in methods that serve specific purposes such as 
                               manipulating strings, arrays, objects, handling events, interacting with DOM and many more.
                               Additonally, we ca also create custom functions to meet specific requirement in their code 
                               but these would not be considered as built-in JavaScript methods. Now we will see numerous 
                               built-in methods of JavaScript.


a)slice() : The slice() method is an built-in method of JavaScript for string which is used to extract a portion/section of 
            given string and will return a new string which consists of the extracted part. The method will not modify the
            original string. It accept two parameters in it i.e., first index and last index.
            
            Syntax : given_string.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
                     wehere, startIndex is inclusive
                             endIndex is exclusive 

Note: endIndex is exclusive i.e., it will not include the value in the extracted part which lies at the endIndex. So, to 
      include it, we have to considered the very first index after endIndex i.e., endIndex+1. Therefore above syntax can 
      also be written as :

      Syntax : given_string.slice(startIndex, endIndex+1);
  
            Examples:let str = "tildetech and development";
                     let sliceStr = str.slice(5, 9); // extracting "tech"
                     console.log("Given string before extraction using slice: " + str);
                     console.log("String after extraction using slice method: ");
                     console.log(sliceStr);
                     //Using slice() method inside console.log() :
                     console.group(str.slice(5, 25));
                     //Original array is not modified
                     console.log("Original array is not modified: " + str);   

b)substr(): The substr() method in JavaScript is a method of String object which is used to extract a portion of the given 
            string i.e., a substring which accepts two parameters, one is starting index and second one is a length. The substr() 
            method returns a new string which is the portion(substring) of the given string and it will not disturb or altered 
            the original string. 
          ->The substr() method in JavaScript is a String object method used for extracting a substring from a specified starting 
            index up to a specified length within a given string. The method is employed to obtain a portion of the string based on 
            the provided parameters, allowing developers to manipulate and work with substrings effectively. 

    Syntax: string.substr(starting_index, length); or,
            variableName.substr(starting_index, length);

            Here, starting_index : the specified index from where extraction is to begin withing the given string.
                  length : It is length of the extracted string i.e., subsring. In other words, it is the number of 
                           characters to be extracted from starting_index.

Note: *The substr() method returns a substring that has been extracted from the given string, the starting_index and 
       length to extract.
      *The substr() method does not chnage the value of the given string. 
      *If, only the starting index is specified, then it wil return a ortion of the string from the given specified 
       index up to the last character of the string.

      Example: let cityName = "Muzaffarpur";
               let substr1 = cityName.substr(8);
               console.log(substr1);
               console.log(cityName.substr(0)); 
      *If you specify "undefined" as starting_index, then the substr() method will treat it as, starting index is 0,
       effectively extracting the substring from the beginning of the given string.
       Example:let address = "Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India"    
               console.log(address.substr(undefined, 11));
               console.log(address.substr(undefined, 18));
               console.log(address.substr(undefined)); 

Note: The substr() method is no longer recommended in JavaScript. That means it is deprecated. Instead, it is recommended 
      to use substring().
